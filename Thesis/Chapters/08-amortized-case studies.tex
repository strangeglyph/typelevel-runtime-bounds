\chapter{Case Study: Binomial Heaps}
\label{ch:casestudyamortized}
As an example of how to use the framework we developed in the last chapter, let us take a look at binomial heaps. A heap is a data structure designed for quick access (and usually removal) of a minimum element. Use cases include, among other things, priority queues and sorting algorithms. Binomial heaps in particular were originally invented by Vuillemin \cite{vuillemin:1978:binheaps} and are special in that they combine a low-complexity implementation with reasonably fast operations, in particular computing the union of two heaps in logarithmic time.

\section{Theoretical Background}
First, we need to define binomial \emph{trees}. Binomial trees are already heaps in their own right, but with one notable restriction: The size of each tree is always a power of two. The logarithm of the size of a tree is called its rank.

A rank zero tree is just a single node:

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
    \input{Tikz/binomial-tree-rank-0.tex}
\end{center}
\caption{Binomial tree of rank 0}
\label{fig:binomial:rank0}
\end{figure}

A rank $n$ binomial tree is a root node with $n$ children: the first a rank $n-1$ tree, the second a rank $n-2$ child and so on. The value of each child node must be larger than that of the root node (\autoref{fig:binomial:rankn}).

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
    \input{Tikz/binomial-tree-rank-n.tex}
\end{center}
\caption{Binomial trees of higher ranks}
\label{fig:binomial:rankn}
\end{figure}

We can join (or link, or merge) two trees of the same rank quickly by comparing their root nodes. The tree with the larger root becomes a child of the tree with the smaller one, increasing the rank of the new tree by one (\autoref{fig:binomial:merge}).

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
    \input{Tikz/binomial-tree-merge.tex}
\end{center}
\caption{Merging two binomial trees}
\label{fig:binomial:merge}
\end{figure}

Using these trees, we can now construct a binomial heap capable of storing any number of elements. We model a heap as a list of binomial trees of strictly increasing rank. A heap with $n$ elements has at most $1 + \lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor$ trees: The largest tree in this heap has rank $\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor$ and then there can be only $\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor$ trees with a smaller rank.

To find the minimum element, we iterate over all trees in the heap, finding the minimum among their root elements. Since there are only $\log n$ trees, this runs in $\mathcal O(\log n)$.

To insert an element into a heap, we create a rank zero tree containing just that element. Then we see if the heap contains a rank zero tree. If not, we can simply add the tree to the heap. Otherwise, we merge the two trees and repeat the process with the resulting rank one tree. This takes $k$ steps in total, where $k$ is the first rank for which no tree exists in the heap, $\mathcal O(\log n)$ in the worst case. However, we can show that the amortized runtime of an insert is constant:

Let $h$ be a heap. We define $\varphi(h)$ as the number of trees in the heap. Let

\[h' = insert(x, h)\]
\vskip 1em

be the result of inserting an element $x$ into $h$ and $k$ the minimum rank for which $h$ does not contain a tree. Then

\[t(insert(x, h)) = k\]
\vskip 1em

and

\[t_{am}(insert(x, h)) = k - \varphi(h) + \varphi(insert(x, h)).\]
\vskip 1em

Observe that the first $k$ trees of $h$ are removed after insertion because they are merged with the new tree. Instead, a new tree of rank $k$ is added. This means that $\varphi(insert(x, h)) = \varphi(h) - k + 1$ and thus $t_{am}(insert(x, h)) = 1$. A sequence of $n$ insert operations on an empty tree therefore has total amortized runtime $n$, so a single operation runs in amortized time $\mathcal O(1)$.

We can also merge two heaps in $\mathcal O(\log \max(k_1, k_2))$ where $k_1$ and $k_2$ are the number of elements in either heap. Starting at rank zero, we check if the two heaps both contain a tree of that rank. If not, we simply copy the tree of the heap that does, or leave the slot empty if neither does. If both heaps contain a tree, we join the two and insert the result into the result heap at rank one. We then continue with the next rank. Observe that after merging up to and including rank $(n-1)$, we will have filled at most the rank $n$ slot of the result heap. If both trees contain a rank $n$ tree, we merge them into a rank $(n+1)$ tree and insert that. If only one heap does and the result also contains a rank $n$ tree from the previous merge step, we merge these two into a rank $(n+1)$ tree. By our invariant, this slot is still free. Put the merged rank $(n+1)$ tree thus maintains that invariant as we have just completed the merge up to tank $n$. Otherwise, if only one of the two heaps and not the result contains a rank $n$ tree, we insert that single tree into the result. Each individual merge step runs in time $\mathcal O(1)$, and therefore the full merge runs in time $\mathcal O(\log \max(k_1, k_2))$.

Finally, we can remove the minimum element from a heap in time $\mathcal O(\log n)$. We find the minimum element as before. This time, we remove this tree in its entirety from the heap. This still leaves us with a valid heap. Since the child elements of a tree of rank $n$ are trees of rank $0$ to $n-1$, we can consider these child elements a heap in their own right (recall that we model heaps as lists of trees with distinct ranks). We therefore merge the child elements of the removed tree back into the main heap. Finding the minimum tree takes time $\mathcal O(\log n)$. Both the heap after removing a full tree and the heap formed by the children have a size less than the original heap. The merge therefore completes in time $\mathcal O(\log n)$ as well.

\section{Implementation}
With the theory out of the way, let us now consider how to implement this in our framework for amortized analysis.

A descending list of length $l$ of a type indexed by the natural numbers is a list where the first element is indexed by $l$, the second by $l-1$ and so on up to the $l$-th element indexed by zero (\autoref{lst:binomial:tree}, lines 1-3). A binomial tree over a set $A$ is then either a leaf of rank zero, containing just a single element of $A$ (line 5), or a node of rank $l+1$ containing an element of $A$ and a descending list of binomial trees of length $l$ (lines 7-9)

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Definition of a binomial tree},label={lst:binomial:tree},emph={DescList,BinomialTree,Leaf,Node}]
data DescList (A : bNat -> Set a) : bNat -> Set a where
    D[_] : A 0 -> DescList A 0
    _D::_ : A (suc l) -> DescList A l -> DescList A (suc l)

data BinomialTree (A : Set a) : bNat -> Set a where
    Leaf : A -> BinomialTree A 0
    Node :  A
         -> DescList (BinomialTree A) l
         -> BinomialTree A (suc l)

tSize : BinomialTree A l -> bNat
tSize {l = l} _ = 2 ^ l

tVal : BinomialTree A l -> A
tVal (Leaf x) = x
tVal (Node x _) = x
\end{lstlisting}

We can merge two trees of equal rank in constant time:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Merging two trees},label={lst:binomial:link},emph={link,Leaf,Node,if,then,else}]
link :  BinomialTree A l
     -> BinomialTree A l
     -> DecTree A (BinomialTree A (suc l)) 1
link (Leaf l) (Leaf r) = if l ≤? r
                         then return (Node l $ D[ Leaf r ])
                         else return (Node r $ D[ Leaf l ])
link l@(Node x xs) r@(Node y ys) =
                         if x ≤? y
                         then return (Node x $ r D:: xs)
                         else return (Node y $ l D:: ys)
\end{lstlisting}

A heap is represented as a contiguous list running from some minimum rank $l$ to rank $l + k$. At every position there is either a binomial tree of that rank or an empty slot. Slots below $l$ or above $l + k$ are implicitly left empty. The list is indexed by two natural numbers: The minimum rank, $l$, and the total number of elements stores in the heap. The number of entries of such a list is the number of trees (or: non-empty slots) contained in it.

An empty heap can have any minimum rank and contains an element (\autoref{lst:binomial:heap}, line 2). An empty entry extends a heap with minimum rank $l+1$ to one with minimum rank $l$ (lines 3-4). Finally, a filled entry combines a tree of rank $l$ with a heap with minimum rank $l+1$ and $acc$ items into a heap of minimum rank $l$ and $2^l + acc$ items (lines 5-9).

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Definition of a binomial heap},label={lst:binomial:heap},emph={SparseTreeList,empty,entry,BinomialTree,entries}]
data SparseTreeList (A : Set a) : bNat -> bNat -> Set a where
    []        :  SparseTreeList A l 0
    empty::   :  SparseTreeList A (suc l) acc
              -> SparseTreeList A l acc
    entry_::_ :  {l acc acc' : bNat}
              -> {acc'\equiv2^l+acc : acc' \equiv 2 ^ l + acc}
              -> BinomialTree A l
              -> SparseTreeList A (suc l) acc
              -> SparseTreeList A l acc'


ts-acc : SparseTreeList A l acc -> bNat
ts-acc {acc = acc} _ = acc

entries : SparseTreeList A l acc -> bNat
entries [] = 0
entries (empty:: ts) = entries ts
entries (entry _ :: ts) = 1 + entries ts
\end{lstlisting}

For completeness' sake we prove that the number of entries of a heap is bounded by the logarithm of total elements stored. As usual with long purely mathematical proofs we omit the proof body. The signature can be found in \autoref{lst:binomial:bounded}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={The length of a heap is bounded},label={lst:binomial:bounded},emph={SparseTreeList, entries}]
len\leq\lfloorlog\_2acc\rfloor :  (ts : SparseTreeList A l acc)
              -> entries ts \leq 1+\lfloorlog\_2 acc \rfloor
\end{lstlisting}

We can now provide \texttt{Amortized} declarations for a heap. We have two: One for heaps over a type $A$ and one for heaps over a type $A$ with minimum rank $0$.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Amortized declaration},label={lst:binomial:amortized},emph={tlist,amortized,Amortized}]
tlist-amortized0 :  (A : Set a)
                 -> Amortized (SparseTreeList A 0)
Amortized.i\_0        (tlist-amortized0 A) = 0
Amortized.initial   (tlist-amortized0 A) = []
Amortized.potential (tlist-amortized0 A) = entries
Amortized.init\equiv0    (tlist-amortized0 A) = refl

tlist-amortized' :  (A : Set a)
                 -> Amortized1 (SparseTreeList A)
Amortized1.i\_0        (tlist-amortized' A)   = 0
Amortized1.initial   (tlist-amortized' A) l = []
Amortized1.potential (tlist-amortized' A)   = entries
Amortized1.init\equiv0    (tlist-amortized' A) l =
        \leq-antisym (len\leq\lfloorlog\_2acc\rfloor
            (Amortized1.initial (tlist-amortized' A) l))
        z\leqn
\end{lstlisting}

We implement insertion into a heap where the minimum rank of the heap matches the rank of the inserted tree. This is sufficient for insertion of single elements into a heap with minimum rank zero.

If the heap is empty or the rank $n$ slot is free, this means simply slotting the tree at the right position (\autoref{lst:binomial:insert}, lines 6-7). Otherwise, we merge the new and the present tree (line 9) and insert them in the remainder of the heap (line 12).

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Inserting into a heap},label={lst:binomial:insert},emph={BinomialTree,SparseTreeList,insertTList,empty,entry}]
insertTList\equiv :  BinomialTree A l
             -> (ts : SparseTreeList A l acc)
             -> DecTree A
                  (SparseTreeList A l (2 ^ l + acc))
                  (leadingEntries ts)
insertTList\equiv t [] = return $ entry t :: []
insertTList\equiv t (empty:: ts) = return $ entry t :: ts
insertTList\equiv t (entry t' :: ts) = do
    t-join <- link t t'
    tlist-dec-subst-acc
        (+-assoc (2 ^ l) (2 ^ l) acc') $
    empty:: <$> insertTList\equiv t-join ts
\end{lstlisting}

Now we can show that a single insertion's amortized runtime is constant. Recall that the amortized runtime is the actual runtime (leading non-empty entries in the tree) plus the change in potential (total non-empty entries).

For the empty heap and a heap with a leading empty entry, this is straightforward (\autoref{lst:binomial:constinsert}, lines 7-9).

In the non-empty case, we insert a tree $t$ into a heap $ts$, that is, a tree $x$ concatenated with a heap $ts'$ (line 10). We first use the fact that $leadingEntries(ts) - entries(ts)$ reduces to $leadingEntries(ts')-entries(ts')$ (line 11-12 contrasted with 17-18). We then show that the number of entries when inserting $t$ into $ts$ is the same as when inserting the linked tree $link(t, x)$ into $ts'$ (proof in lines 27ff., used in line 13 contrasted with lines 19-20). We can then show this rewritten runtime to be equal to 1 by recursing on $link(t, x)$ and $ts'$.

            \qed

\end{lstlisting}

We can use this to show that performing $n$ insertions into an empty list runs in $\mathcal O(n)$. First, we define an amortized computation performing $n$ insertions from a vector (\autoref{lst:binomial:ins-in-linear-time}, lines 1-5). We then show that the total amortized runtime of this computation is exactly $n$ (line 9): Initially, we recurse on the first $n-1$ insertions (line 15 contrasted with line 22) and then apply the lemma from \autoref{lst:binomial:constinsert} to substitute the second term with 1 (line 22-24 contrasted with line 28).

In a similar vein, we can implement the remaining operations of a binomial heap: Merging two heaps, finding the minimum element and building on top of that, removing the minimum element from the heap. We list just there function signatures and omit the bodies for brevity's sake; the proof patterns used are similar to those used in \autoref{lst:binomial:constinsert} and \autoref{lst:binomial:ins-in-linear-time}.
