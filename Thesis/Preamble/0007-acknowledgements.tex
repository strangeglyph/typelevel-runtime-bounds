I'd like to thank the members of Freenode's \#\#agda channel for helping me with my many, many questions while learning Agda.

Additional thanks go to Tobias and Momo for proof reading my thesis and ....

Finally and most importantly my thanks go to my family and my partner, who kept me sane during the stressful times of this thesis and during the crazy year that Covid has given us all. You mean the world to me.
