    \begin{abstract}
	   The rise of dependently typed language offers the opportunity to formally verify resource constraints such as memory usage of data structures and run-time bounds of algorithms. We investigate how to leverage the type system to encode correct-by-construction upper bounds for the run-time of different algorithms.
